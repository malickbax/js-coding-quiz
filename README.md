## User Story
As a coding boot camp student, I wanted to build a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. Given a code quiz: 

- When I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
- When I answer a question, I am presented with another question.
- When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 seconds, the game is over.
- When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.
